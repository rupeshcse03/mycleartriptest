Now while talking domain specific language, the next step is to move away from mentioning pages in the application
to rather encapsulate the same with the actual users of the application,

What i mean here is for the sake of readability and even in day to day business use the domain experts care more about
who does what than how he does it?

So kind of moving the mechanism of "how" from the test scenario language.

For achieving the same we have created a specification layer, a class called AppUser and that user is the one who is doing
all sort of stuff in the application.

This is a very thin layer with hardly any logic of its own. It's just passing down stuff to the pages and helping build
the specification to be used in the scenario.

Also, look at how it manages navigation between pages.
