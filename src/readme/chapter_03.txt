Now lets add a second scenario to our test class.


Given the user is on cleartrip home page
When he searches with details for a return journey
Then he should get both outbound and inbound journey options

With these two scenarios we have quite a bit of common  setup steps between the two tests. Precisely things like:
    Creating a driver instance
    Launching the application under test
    Closing the browser once the test is complete

So for the common steps we create
    a setup method for all common steps before both the tests
    a teardown method to close the browsers once the tests are completed


Notice the TestNG annotation @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod on setup and teardown methods respectively.
These annotations would make the setup and teardown methods to run before and after every test method in our scenario
class.
