With all that awesome readability in place, let us add some sugar coating to make it read a proper
Given, When, And, Then kind of test scenario.

Look at the methods given, when, then in this chapter.
They just encapsulate the whole test scenario statement from a user's perspective and return the same from these methods.

So now our test looks exactly how we had defined it in the very beginning(Chapter 1).

Awesome!!
